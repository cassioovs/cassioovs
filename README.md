## My timeline with technology

### 2015 

I started my career with hardware and software serving friends and family while studying programming languages, networking, and overclocking.

### 2020 - 2023

Won the opportunity to work in a systems integrator hub, focused on the e-commerce area.

At that time, the company already had more than 120 different integrations, including: Sales Channels, ERPs, E-commerces, Logistics and Payment Gateways, etc...

Thus, you can learn even more and put your studies into practice.

### 2023

I started my journey as a systems analyst, with a primary focus on incident support (back-end) and a secondary focus on new changes and integrations for the e-commerce area.

At this moment, following a new journey with a happy heart, being able to appreciate and learn the teachings of software engineers and infrastructure architects with a focus on omnichannel.
